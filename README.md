# ISLAND

The goal of the project is to practice the application of multithreading in Java. It implements a map figuratively named as Island.
On this island are animals that move, reproduce, hunt and die.
Each kind of animal is a separate thread that interacts with other threads.
For example, there may be a situation where there are predators on the map that hunt other animals and the algorithm takes into account
which animals are encountered and what percentage of success they have in the hunt. It also happens that the animal has not eaten anything for a long time dies of starvation.
